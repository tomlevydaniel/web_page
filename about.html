        <h1>
            I am a graduate of the School of Architecture at Torcuato Di Tella University, oriented to the development
            of projects and their construction through iterative design using digital tools, such as algorithm assisted
            design programs - Grasshopper, modeling as Rhinoceros, Blender and its postproduction with Photoshop,
            Illustrator. <br> <br>
            Since my graduation in 2020, I have been working at <a href="https://g19ar.com/" target=”_blank”>G19</a>, a commercial architecture firm in Argentina for one year.
            Then, I worked as a consulting architect for the Neom Mountain Ski Village project at  <a href="https://www.aedas.com/" target=”_blank”>AEDAS</a>
            as a temporary contract. Also, as a freelancer, I have developed artwork and animations, many of which I sold on the crypto-art platform Rarible. 
            I am also currently studying Javascript, which will be a perfect complement.

            <br> <br>
            I am eager to join a collaborative team to develop creative and highly complex projects. I am interested
            in bringing my knowledge in the field of architecture and design, complemented by my skills in the use of
            digital tools.
            <br> <br>
