        <h1>
            I am a graduate of the School of Architecture at Torcuato Di Tella University, oriented to the development
            of projects and their construction through iterative design using digital tools, such as algorithm assisted
            design programs - Grasshopper, modeling as Rhinoceros, Blender and its postproduction with Photoshop,
            Illustrator. <br>
            I am eager to join a collaborative team to develop creative and highly complex projects. I am interested
            in bringing my knowledge in the field of architecture and design, complemented by my skills in the use of
            digital tools.
